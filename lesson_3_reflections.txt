Q1  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  On almost all projects, but the advantages come when working from different locations and PCs.
  When working collaboratively on a project with others in different locations.
  
Q2  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	First, Git seems to always prefer the fine-grained option over the automatic one. This gives
	the owner full control of git operations. When every action is intentional, it is more likely
	to be more meaningful and more memorable. It will prevent pulling unwanted or unneeded branches
	and commits and allow you to focus on only the parts you want to (if in a big collaborative project, for example).

Q3  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are like brances of whole repositories on GitHub and would be used when taking some
	one else's work in a new direction, not necessarily with their involvement.

	Clones are exact copies of repositories	made on local PC or between GitHub and local PC, and
	are used to copy a complete set of repository files between two locations.

	Branches are only splits of commits, and are used when files and file edits might benefit from
	going in different directions.
